#Dynamic programming - IngredientsMove 

After returning from vacation, you saw the following ingredients in your kitchen cupboard (availableIngredients)
You want to make pancakes for dinner. The pancake recipe requires the following ingredients (recipeIngredients)
You can only leave as many ingredients as are in the pancake recipe in your cupboard.
Ingredients currently in the cupboard you can:
- leave if they fit
- put them on the countertop (remove them from the cabinet) to make room for the missing ones
- or buy/add new ones to the shelf, missing ones.
In total, how many transfers to the countertop or addition of new ingredients should you make so that in the end you only have ingredients for pancakes?
